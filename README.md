Price Prediction from Kaggle's Ames Iowa housing dataset 
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dsi-us-11-project-2-regression-challenge/data>
This is my first project for Certificate in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence with Institue of Data. 

Goal: To predict Sale Price for each house in the test file based on houses sold during 2006 â€“ 2010 using Linear Regression with Ridge & Lasso regalarization techniques.
Performance was measured by R-squared score & Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE )
